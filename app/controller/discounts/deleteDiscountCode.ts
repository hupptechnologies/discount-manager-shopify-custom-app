/**
	* Deletes a single discount code (either basic or automated) from the Shopify store and the app's database.
	* 
	* This function allows you to delete one discount code at a time, whether it's a basic discount or an automated discount code.
	* The function will process the deletion of the provided discount code based on the `discountID` passed in the payload.
	* 
	* - The `discountID` refers to the unique identifier of the discount code that you want to delete.
	* 
	* The function ensures that the specified discount code is removed both from the Shopify store and from the appâ€™s database.
	* 
	* @param {string} shop - The domain of the Shopify store (e.g., 'my-shop.myshopify.com').
	* @param {DeleteDiscountCodeInput} dataPayload - The payload containing the `discountID` of the discount code to be deleted.
	* 
	* @returns {Promise<DeleteResponse>} - A promise that resolves with the status of the deletion process.
